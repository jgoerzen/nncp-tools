#+TITLE: Tunneling NNCP over other transports

* Background

NNCP has built-in support for running over TCP, with nncp-daemon and nncp-call/caller.  NNCP's own [[https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Use-cases.html][use cases]] page talks about various use cases for NNCP.  Some of them, such as the [[https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/UsecaseNoLink.html][no link]] page, cover use of nncp-xfer; others, such as the [[https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/UsecaseBroadcast.html][one-way broadcasting]] page go over nncp-bundle.

Here I build on all of these tools (daemon, call, xfer, and bundle) to show how they can be used to build even more communication methods.

* The tools

The [[https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Commands.html][NNCP commands]] we'll be using are:

- nncp-daemon :: Normally listens on a TCP port, but can also interact over stdin/stdout.  We can use this, for instance, over ssh.
